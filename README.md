# my_first_site
 
These are the "sites" i've created while i followed a full stack developer roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack).

They're made with the intent that you need to look at the source code at the same as you're viewing the page in the browser of your choice. This helps understand what is going on in the web page.

- Learnt HTML in 1.5 days
- Learnt CSS in 3 days
- Learning JS

It is highly recommended to follow the same tutorials to try and reproduce these sites.

HOWEVER, you DO NOT want to get stuck in tutorial hell, so i would recommend building a few websites to test your skills. Keep in mind that the websites dont have to be nice looking or functional, they're only made to test your skills and not to ship to customers
