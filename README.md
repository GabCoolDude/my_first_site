# my_first_site
 
These are the "sites" i've created while i followed a full stack developer roadmap on [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/full-stack).

They're made with the intent that you need to look at the source code at the same as you're viewing the page in the browser of your choice. This helps understand what is going on on the web page.

- Learnt HTML in 1.5 days
- Learnt CSS in 3 days
- Learning JS

It is highly recommended to follow the same tutorials to try and reproduce these sites.
